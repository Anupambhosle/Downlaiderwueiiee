## Usage

When viewing a Patreon Post page, you can use the `Patreon Downloader` to quickly download all of the media and attachments from that post into a folder in your Downloads folder.

The folder name will be pre-filled for you based on the Patreon creator's name and the title of the post.

For example, if you were downloading from creator `JohnSmith` and the title of the post was `These are some of my favourite things...` you would be given a folder name of `johnsmith-these-are-some-of-my-favourite-things`.

Simply change the folder name to suit you, or delete it entirely if you want to download straight to your Downloads folder.
